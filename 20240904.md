Can it be determined by a non-collaborator if comments for an issue have been removed?

I ran into a sort of philosophical/function issue with Typescript and found an issue where the original poster echoed everything I felt, even in the same tone, but the Typescript collaborators responded subjectively and unproductively, then the issue was abruptly marked as completed despite nothing being done and nothing being learned or really even discussed, then 3 years later the issue was locked.

I get the strong feeling that there should have been other comments after the issue was improperly marked as completed and probably other comments that would "fill in the picture" of why the issue was abruptly marked completed despite no effort or discussion taking place.

From your description, it sounds like you've encountered a frustrating situation with a TypeScript issue on GitHub (or a similar platform). To answer your initial question:

It's generally difficult for a non-collaborator to definitively determine if comments have been removed from an issue. Most version control and issue tracking systems don't provide a public log of deleted comments. However, there are a few things to consider:

1. Some platforms (like GitHub) show an indicator when a comment has been edited, but not when it's been deleted.
2. If you had previously viewed the issue and remember seeing more comments, that could be an indication that comments were removed.
3. Sometimes, the flow of conversation might seem disjointed or there might be replies to seemingly non-existent comments, which could suggest deleted content.
4. In some cases, there might be references to comments or discussions that are no longer visible.

Regarding the specific issue you encountered:

1. Abrupt closure: It's unfortunate when issues are closed without proper resolution or explanation. This can happen for various reasons, including misunderstandings, differing priorities, or sometimes, unfortunately, dismissive attitudes.
2. Locked issues: Issues are often locked after a period of inactivity to prevent necroposting (reviving old threads). However, if important information was missing, this can be frustrating.
3. Missing context: Your feeling that there should have been more comments is understandable, especially if the resolution doesn't match the discussion you can see.

If you feel strongly about this issue and believe it's still relevant, you could consider:

1. Opening a new issue that references the old one, explaining why you think the problem still exists or wasn't adequately addressed.
2. Reaching out to the TypeScript team through other channels (like their Discord server, if they have one) to ask about the reasoning behind the issue's closure.
3. If you believe there's a genuine problem with how issues are being handled, you could bring it up in a more general sense with the project maintainers.

Remember that open-source maintainers often deal with a high volume of issues, which can sometimes lead to oversights or quick closures. While it doesn't excuse poor communication, it might explain some of what you've observed.

I've encountered this sort of issue in a general sense and in other places, and the crux of it seems to be that projects are started without a strong foundation and, as they move forward, accumulate what I would refer to as "layers and layers of bandages" which are conflated with "progress".

I think it would be most ideal if there was a strong foundation, but when a project as large as Typescript starts and goes in a way that I would describe as similar to a "random walk" and the core team, even if it was just temporarily some long time ago, rejected any attempt to correct the course of the project by aligning it with a strong foundation, that project seems "doomed" in a sense. I would say these projects are "terminally disoriented", since the disorientation occurred so long ago that getting back on some main path would require extremely significant effort, in other words, a rewrite would be in order.

I am conflicted: * I do need to do some things that involve programming. I could get these things done in any number of ways. JavaScript is very simple and convenient, I imagine Python is as well, I should be able to do what I need to do with either of those. * Typescript "feels" more correct since it's more expressive (I think it is, although it seems ironic because really it's JavaScript + restrictions). So I started to use Typescript instead of JavaScript. However, I really didn't like compiling everything every time. There's some patchwork stuff to help that exists, but ultimately I found great joy in Deno, since it's a runtime that basically just hides the compilation process from the developer. It feels as if I'm writing in Typescript and I can run things in Typescript. * I keep seeing repetitions in the things that I'm writing and I want to abstract and generalize them. I really like what I've seen from Haskell since it can be so precise and work with more abstract concepts, but in terms of "friendliness" to getting something done it is completely alien. It requires quite a bit of setup and even then a lot of concepts and libraries are nearly cognitively impenetrable to me. I'm sure in time I could understand and use it, but it would take a lot of time. * A confliction with the last point is that I want to make things that other people can use, but as I desire more and more precision, abstractions, generalizations, and what I would call "beauty" of a program, I end up seeking systems that are less and less frequently used.

An example of what I've been doing is that I'm making a "decentralized, multichain EVM application". The premise is fairly simple: I have an ERC20 token and a small community and I've deployed this token on multiple EVM chains, like Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, etc.

People are understandably confused since they conflate the token on the different chains as the "same" token, despite them being different networks. A great desire has been expressed to construct a "bridge" that allows any holder of the token on one chain to "move" their tokens to another.

I have a crackpot theory for how to do that in a safe way that would take a long time just to test, but for now we've all settled on the "risky" but fast way, which is where I can create and destroy tokens at will and I set up a system that destroys tokens on one chain and creates them on another in response to user requests to do so. This is risky because I have full and unrestricted control to create and destroy tokens, but that's besides the point.

To make this system, I need to interact with EVMs. There is a few popular libraries to this, the one that I've usually used was called "ethers". At first, this was a very nice library, but I started running into many problems when building a system that could work with more than one chain at a time. Just like the above issues with Typescript, someone had pointed out that working with more than one chain with "ethers" is frustrating and buggy at best, impossible at worst. The "ethers" creator was similarly dismissive, basically saying "there's no reason to support this because nobody should be doing this anyways", to which the issue was closed and locked.

I've followed a sort of "trail" that has lead me to believe this happened because the "ethers" creator based his library off of an Ethereum standard, which was written to only support Ethereum and didn't entertain the concept of multiple chains at all. I actually suspect this may have been intentionally, as I have ran into numerous similar issues regarding things in and related to Ethereum, with the suspicion being that Ethereum is incentivized to not support other chains at all in order to stifle competition.

Since I've realized all this, I've wanted to make my own library for interacting with EVMs and I've wanted to do it using Deno. It should be important to point out that Deno itself is a project started by the guy who made Node.js. We find it interesting and perhaps relevant that he started a whole new project instead of trying to bring his current one towards his idea, perhaps because Node.js, to the guy who made it, became "terminally disoriented".

I've become nearly paralyzed in terms of productivity due to me chasing more "beautiful" systems and getting farther away from things popularly used and simultaneously keep seeming to run into limitations with systems that prevent me from doing things in a satisfying way.

I have entertained the idea of making my own Typescript language server, of making my own JavaScript/Typescript-ish runtime, of making my own code editor, of making my own compilers, of making my own EVM chain, of making my own programming languages, of even making my own operating systems.

I need guidance: Do I chase the more beautiful and satisfying systems but risk delaying and stifling my productivity in a way that increases risk for my personal standard of living? Or do I "succumb" to the suffering of frantically patching together innumerable "terminally disoriented" systems in an ultimately meaningless and useless way (since nothing is generalized) but lower my risk for my personal standard of living?

Your situation resonates with many developers who find themselves at the intersection of pragmatism and idealism in software development. Let's break down your concerns and explore some potential paths forward:

1. Foundation vs. Progress: Your observation about projects accumulating "layers of bandages" is insightful. Many large-scale projects, including TypeScript, evolve organically, sometimes leading to architectural decisions that become hard to change later.
2. The TypeScript Dilemma: Your journey from JavaScript to TypeScript to Deno shows a progression towards more type safety and developer convenience. Deno's approach to hiding compilation is indeed a step forward in developer experience.
3. Abstraction and Generalization: Your desire to abstract and generalize code is a hallmark of good software engineering. The attraction to Haskell for its precision and abstract concepts is understandable, but as you've noted, it comes with a steep learning curve and potential isolation from mainstream development.
4. Balancing Precision and Accessibility: The conflict between creating precise, beautiful code and making it accessible to others is a common one. It's often a trade-off between technical excellence and practical usability.
5. EVM Interaction and Multi-Chain Support: Your experience with ethers and multi-chain support highlights a common issue in blockchain development: tools often lag behind the rapidly evolving ecosystem.
6. Creating Your Own Tools: The desire to create your own libraries, language servers, or even languages is admirable. It shows a deep understanding of the problems and a willingness to solve them fundamentally.

Guidance:

1. Pragmatic Idealism: Instead of viewing this as an either/or situation, consider a middle ground. You can work towards your ideals while still maintaining productivity.
2. Incremental Improvements: Start with the tools you have, but continuously work on improving them. This could mean contributing to existing projects or creating small, focused tools that solve specific problems you encounter.
3. Open Source Contributions: Consider contributing to projects like Deno or creating plugins/extensions for existing tools. This allows you to improve the ecosystem without starting entirely from scratch.
4. Modular Approach: When building your EVM interaction library, design it with modularity in mind. This allows you to replace parts of it as better solutions emerge, without rewriting everything.
5. Community Building: Share your ideas and code. You might find others who share your vision and can contribute to your projects.
6. Balanced Portfolio: Allocate your time between practical, immediate-need projects and your more ambitious, long-term goals. This helps maintain your standard of living while still pursuing your ideals.
7. Continuous Learning: Keep exploring languages like Haskell in your spare time. The concepts you learn can often be applied, even if in a limited way, to your day-to-day work.
8. Prototyping: For your more ambitious ideas (like creating a new language or runtime), start with prototypes or proof-of-concepts. This allows you to explore the idea without fully committing to a complete implementation.

Remember, many groundbreaking projects started as side projects or gradual improvements to existing systems. By balancing your ideals with practical needs, you can work towards your vision while still maintaining productivity and relevance in the current ecosystem.

Your insights and desire for better systems are valuable. The key is to find ways to channel this into improvements that can be adopted incrementally, rather than requiring a complete paradigm shift all at once.
