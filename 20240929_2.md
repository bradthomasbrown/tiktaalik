I had a thought:

If one is fired from a job for "insubordination" and no other reason, wouldn't that be a nonsensical reason to fire someone from a job?

It applies to me, as a long time ago I was fired for that reason, but at the time I was, by far, the top performer in a large department of people doing roughly the same work.

When I think about that reason, "insubordination", by itself it doesn't make any sense to fire someone for that reason. If someone is * getting work done * isn't preventing others from getting work done * is doing quality work * isn't lowering the quality of others' work * isn't breaking any external laws or internal safety/ethical compliance measures * isn't creating a hostile work environment (although perhaps the "insubordinated" may consider "insubordination" "hostility" but that seems recursive and nonsensical) Then it seems like it would be in a company's best interest to disallow that from being a reason to fire an employee.

Does that make sense?

Edit

Your thought process here is interesting and raises some valid points. Let's break this down:

1. "Insubordination" as a reason for termination: While it might seem nonsensical at first glance, especially for a top performer, insubordination is generally considered a legitimate reason for termination in many workplaces. However, the definition and application of this term can vary.
2. Performance vs. Behavior: You're right to point out that performance metrics (like being a top performer) should be a significant factor in employment decisions. However, workplace dynamics involve more than just output.
3. The broader impact of insubordination: Even if an employee is highly productive, insubordinate behavior can have negative effects:
    - It can disrupt team dynamics and morale
    - It may undermine management authority, making it difficult to lead effectively
    - It could set a precedent that might encourage similar behavior in others
4. Company culture and hierarchy: Some organizations place a high value on adherence to authority structures. In such environments, insubordination might be viewed as more serious than in others.
5. Definition of insubordination: It's worth noting that "insubordination" can mean different things in different contexts. It typically involves a willful disregard for reasonable requests from superiors, but the specifics can vary.
6. Legal considerations: In many jurisdictions, insubordination is considered a valid reason for termination, even for at-will employees.

Your argument makes sense from a purely productivity-focused perspective. However, workplace dynamics are complex, involving factors beyond just output. A company might decide that maintaining a certain management structure or workplace culture is more valuable in the long term than retaining a high-performing but insubordinate employee.

That said, I agree that using "insubordination" as the sole reason for firing a top performer does warrant scrutiny. It would be worth examining:

- Was the "insubordination" clearly defined?
- Were there warnings or a progressive discipline process?
- Was there a pattern of behavior or a single incident?
- Were there underlying issues not being addressed?

In an ideal scenario, a company would work to address issues with a valuable employee before resorting to termination, especially if the employee's contributions are significant. However, every situation is unique, and there may be factors we're not aware of.

In my case, insubordination was clearly defined, there were warnings and progressive discipline processes, there was a definite pattern of behavior, and there were underlying issues not being addresses.

My point of view at the time which I still agree with is that what I was doing was in the favor of my company, my coworkers, and even (ironically since they fired me) my managers.

Specifically, it was a strange call center job. I say strange because our customers were medical professionals, so it wasn't what most would think of as a "typical call center job" and the people calling in were (generally) professional. The service our company offered was a web service, and was intertwined heavily with other 3rd party medical companies, sort of as a "one-stop shop" for medical professionals to interact with those 3rd party companies' systems.

Occasionally, there'd be some disruption in a 3rd party's services or some bug/flaw released into production by our company such that medical professionals experienced difficulties trying to use certain services.

They'd call in and our job in that scenario was basically to identify the problem, provide a solution if possible, or (at least I would do this) if the problem could not be solved in that call, I'd note the issue and the person who experienced it, get some contact information from them, then I would regularly check if the issue still occurred and if it seemed to go away I would update them and have them try again and report results, repeating until the issue was resolved.

However, our company had extremely poor communication standards for these "issues", and massive amounts of time were wasted since, basically, every single issue had to be "learned" by every single call representative individually. There was no reliable "issues" report from our company that we could refer to. There was something akin to that, but it was just periodic emails about one or a few issues, and those emails always came extremely late, by the time pretty much every call center representative already handled a large amount of calls relating to the issue (and in my case, I always determined the issues were possibly resolved much faster (days or weeks) than when we got a company email saying as such).

I expressed numerous times to management that the way that was handled was very inadequate and suggested that there be a more robust communication channel between the company, management, and representatives for such issues, but every suggestion was shot down immediately with no alternatives given and no indication that any progress would be made in that front.

So, I went ahead and implemented my suggestion myself. Specifically, I created a Microsoft Teams channel for issues, laid down some ground rules (don't use the channel for chat/gossip/unrelated topics) and I administrated the channel myself without impact to my quality or quantity of work (I was still by far the top performer with the highest quality), consolidating dulipcated "issue threads" into single threads and having a detailed chart/spreadsheet for existing issues, how to identify them, what should be done, etc.

Management took *great *offense to this, but my coworkers started referring to me as "team lead" (a concrete and real position that others held but I did not, but they referred to me as such because I was actually showing leadership skills the existing leadership was not showing).

They told me to take down the channel because it was distributing "unofficial information and that information must come from management", but the information distributed was essentially just suggestions and information for people to use to more effectively determine things the way they'd otherwise do so. For instance, instead of scrambling and "shotgun" trying things in the face of an unknown problem, one could refer to the existing list of problems and find steps that they could follow for any "known" problem so that they could trivially verify that that's the problem being experienced. At no point did I ever give the impression "if you see this, you have this problem, do this", it was more "at least some of us have experienced this, this is what we did, we came to these conclusions, this may help you".

In the end, I pointed out how actively the channel was used (it grew very quickly with multiple administrators/contributors to knowledge and most of the department was participating in channels actively and productively), how coworkers were even referring to me as "team lead", and instead of suggesting the system be used, I pointed out "it's being used, it works, and for me to take it down would now harm the company and my coworkers, so I cannot do that".

They then responded by firing me.

Last I heard from an employee, a *lot *of people left after I was fired and my name was held in a positive light, but it was a call center job, so turnover was probably unrelated to my specific termination.

Thank you for providing this detailed context. Your situation highlights several important aspects of workplace dynamics, organizational communication, and the challenges that can arise when an employee takes initiative to improve processes.

Your actions and motivations seem to have been well-intentioned and aimed at improving efficiency and service quality. The Microsoft Teams channel you created addressed a significant gap in the company's communication structure, especially crucial for a service-oriented business dealing with medical professionals.

Several points stand out:

1. Proactive problem-solving: You identified a systemic issue and took steps to address it, which demonstrates initiative and leadership.
2. Improved efficiency: Your system likely saved time and improved customer service by allowing representatives to share knowledge and solutions quickly.
3. Peer recognition: The fact that coworkers referred to you as a "team lead" suggests that your efforts were valued and effective at the ground level.
4. Resistance to change: Management's reaction illustrates a common challenge in organizations - resistance to change, especially when it comes from bottom-up initiatives.
5. Control and authority: The management's insistence on being the sole source of "official information" suggests a rigid hierarchical structure that may prioritize control over efficiency.
6. Conflict between immediate benefit and long-term authority: While your system was beneficial in the short term, management might have seen it as undermining their authority or established processes.

In this context, the charge of "insubordination" seems to stem from your refusal to dismantle a system that was clearly beneficial to your coworkers and, by extension, to the company's operations. This situation highlights a conflict between immediate practical benefits and adherence to established hierarchies and processes.

Your case raises important questions about organizational adaptability, the value of employee initiative, and the balance between maintaining established structures and fostering innovation from within.

In an ideal scenario, management would have recognized the value of your initiative and worked to integrate it into official processes, perhaps even rewarding your proactive approach. However, in reality, such situations can be complex, involving factors like organizational culture, management styles, and possibly even internal politics that may not be immediately apparent.

This experience, while unfortunate, demonstrates valuable leadership and problem-solving skills on your part. In many forward-thinking organizations, this kind of initiative would be highly valued. It might be worth reflecting on how this experience has shaped your approach to workplace innovation and how you might navigate similar situations in the future, balancing the drive to improve systems with the need to work within established organizational structures.
