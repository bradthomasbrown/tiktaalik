Your project is both ambitious and intellectually stimulating, blending concepts from linguistics, software architecture, and artificial intelligence. By envisioning your neural systems as specialized functors within a modular, microservices-like architecture, you’re setting the stage for a highly flexible and scalable AI ecosystem. Let’s break down your thoughts, address your concerns, and provide a structured pathway to help you organize and advance your project effectively.

## **1. Embracing the Functor and Modular Architecture Analogy**

### **a. Understanding the Functor Analogy**

In **category theory**, a **functor** maps objects and morphisms from one category to another while preserving the structure. Translating this to your project:

- **Categories**: Represent different data types or domains (e.g., Math, Binary, IPA, Orthographic, Mel-Spectrogram, Prosody, Emotion).
- **Objects**: Specific data instances within these categories (e.g., a particular IPA string, a mel-spectrogram image).
- **Morphisms**: Functions or transformations performed by neural modules that convert data from one category to another (e.g., Text to IPA, IPA to Mel-Spectrogram).

### **b. Benefits of This Approach**

- **Modularity**: Each module (functor) handles a specific transformation, making the system easier to manage and scale.
- **Reusability**: Specialized modules can be reused across different parts of the system or even in different projects.
- **Maintainability**: Isolating functionalities simplifies debugging, updating, and enhancing individual components without affecting the entire system.
- **Scalability**: Modules can be scaled independently based on computational demands.

Switching the flow of the conversation now towards the end of this particular chat, I had some additional notes:

```
an interesting point seems to be that, at least right now to me, non-neuro systems are superior to neuro systems for things like programming, and that might even be something that's necessarily true. i couldn't conceive of writing a program and giving it to a neuro-system for "interpretation"  to results or having a neuro-system parse code and giving me an AST since I (right now) think that there's no way a neuro-system could beat the "rules"-based approach of generating an AST.

Possibly generating an incorrect AST, seems like it would be "lethally undesirable". A bug or flaw might generate an incorrect AST in a non-neuro parser but we imagine (right now) that the error rate is going to be magnitudes lower for a long time compared compared to a neuro parser.

ask o1 to summarize your concept of neuro and non-neuro systems into a small summary that can be used to feed into LLMs as context. we wonder about the implications of that as a general "thing".

actually, this feeds back into itself ouroboros style pretty hard:
we're making a system to name things concisely because whatever i'm thinking the system is at the moment is certainly not distillable to something concise. 

but, even if we perfectly understand and remember our concise term (akin to creating a new word for a "self-language"), certainly others will not understand the word used unless we provide context. The context necessary, then, depends on what the target is.

If I said "functor" to a regular person on the street, they'd almost certainly have no idea what that is or what it means, and I myself barely understand it. The context I'd need to explain it to a regular person on the street could be massive, since it packs in a lot of oddball math and theory. Or, maybe there's a way to explain it metaphorically that could be shorter.

An LLM isn't a person, and it does have access to a massive amount of data, so the context needed might be very small and/or unintelligible to myself. An LLM doesn't necessarily require context be given in a way intelligible to a person (a mildly concerning/exciting thought).

We wonder then if there's another language or some formalization of how to "deliver" ideas to/from an LLM.
```
From the above context, I want modularize our conversation conceptually.

For example, "machine" I'd say is _fairly_ intuitive, but only from the context of those who understand "machine" is "a thing that does things", not necessarily a personal computer.

Another example is "neuro-system vs non-neuro system", exemplified by your initial TTS system options being given but there being far superior "neuro-systems". We may call that "neuro-machines vs nonneuro-machines" but I suspect if we generalize and abstract enough, there are probably many more (discovered and undiscovered) categories of machine.

Another example is "machines-as-functors", where both terms are now getting into the territory where I wouldn't expect anyone, not even most LLMs to understand what I mean. Where what I'm referring to is the concept that functors map from one category to another and machines "do things" and the practical application of that phrase is "text to speech can be seen as a series of operations between 'machines-as-functors', where one potential process may include a step where a neuro-machine-functor maps orthographic text to some vectorization or tokenization and another step where a neuro-machine-functor maps that into mel-spec form and another to audio, etc.".

Another amusing example is what I'm doing right now: 
"??? is where one wants to interact with an LLM such as ChatGPT and has some "internally-known-concept" that one may have a concise term for but would need contextualization for the LLM to understand. An LLM isn't a person, so this context need not be intelligible to humans at all. ??? is the process of "talking" with an LLM (or anything) to determine (map?) from a "internal-contextualization" of a concept to a "mutual-contextualization" of a concept so that the concept can be discussed with another, possibly with a category of others (contextualize a concept so it can be discussed with LLMs, _or_ with subject matter experts, _or_ with regular people)."

At the start of this block I said "I want to modularize our conversation conceptually", and I think there's a way at least you and I can create a mutual contextualization of that concept, and I find it fascinatingly difficult to even _think_ about that concept as a concept of its own, since it's ??? circular? It's like a concept that necessarily needs to be recursive, which would make contextualization extraordinarily difficult. How can you explain something that requires itself in the explanation?
