What is an `yrzuc`?

We say an "input / event to the human machine / function".

Quite abstract, and not necessarily applying to humans, and perhaps applies to more than we described, but we think it captures the basic premise.

To expand, we try to view a human as a JavaScript event listener, which can be computationally thought of as a structure of function pointers that is called when a function is called, or more computationally as machine code blocks that must be jumped to and returned from successively when we jump to some block, where we can add new blocks or remove existing ones from the "list of successive blocks to jump into or out of". We now also see that we could just line up the blocks and it would be the same as a program, so an event listener could be thought of as a dynamic program.

For a human, we imagine that at some given moment, we are "in the middle of processing", although we elect to not say nor care what inputs we are processing and what outputs we may produce, and "in the middle of processing" can be thought of as simply "living".

While we are doing that, we may find that "things" arise that cause us to switch what we are doing. These could be thought of as "events" for an event listener, and these "things" are what I call `yrzuc`s.

A basic example is that if I'm doing something, then I feel hungry, that hunger that I feel is an `yrzuc`, where we may process it by eating. After it is processed, we may go back to whatever we were doing. Something different about `yrzuc`s compared to events and event listeners is that here, we see that one `yrzuc` can have immediacy and priority. We don't finish what we were doing and then eat (maybe we might, if we were near some good stopping point or completion), but we stop what we're doing, thus making the hunger `yrzuc` high priority or "immediate".

We can extend this to nearly or all of everything we conciously or even subconciously experience. Right now, we've organized `caution`, `concept`, `criticism`, and `want`, and we know there will be more categores and that those categories may be altered or removed. For instance `criticism` and `caution` are closely related, where `criticism` is more like "we saw someone do this and we didn't like it, perhaps we should be cautious not to do it ourselves" and where `caution` is more like "we did this or might do this and we didn't/wouldn't like it, so we should be cautious not to do it (again)".

A `concept` may be some thing we think of that we want to keep in mind and address later.

A `want` is something we may want, and this could be a `concept` that has "evolved" or been made higher priority or more immediate.

While processing an `yrzuc`, we may find that doing so generates many more `yrzuc`s in a recursive manner. We find this to be extremely common for ourselves, and often find ourselves "lost in a sea of `yrzuc`s", wondering what it was we were doing that had us end up where we are now.
