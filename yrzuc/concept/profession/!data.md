TUKYO is a visionary.

"I am an artist and so are you"

is the closest and most accurate explanation of what I do, and we're not sure if he knows exactly how and why that might be accurate. Either way, he either conciously or subconciously understands the way cryptocurrency and decentralized finance works at a very deep level.

We conjecture that cryptocurrency/DeFi is a modern version of the historical "patronage" system, with many aspects being taken to wild extremes compared to any historical or other modern versions of that system.

What I do (although it sounds conceited, so I don't like it but I can't think of anything else) is that I am an artist, and the people who hold or held my tokens or interacted with my projects (or "art") are patrons. The barrier to being an artist or patron is made insanely low, such that it makes sense to say:

"I am an artist and so are you"

and perhaps the addendum

"I am a patron and so are you"
