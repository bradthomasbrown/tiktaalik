overloads are very tricky in a lot of langauges it seems.

we have an idea for some arbitrary language where we can provide a program to a function where the purpose of the program is to "pick" which overload we want to target (assuming it for some reason cannot be determined automatically).

some of the ideas for the "program" started as set theory or category notation, or logic notations, combined or included in part or whole in some "proof language" or "overload picker language".

with more recent realizations, we conjecture that computation is the heart of language, so what we would provide would be computations, which is why we say "we can provide a program" that picks an overload in case whatever default overload resolution fails.
