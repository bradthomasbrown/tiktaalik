we have a notion that computation is the heart of language and understanding, perhaps even going so far as to say that all of mathematics and logics are just "computationally not well founded abstractions more tailored for easy and intuitive human understanding"

another way to phrase this is that all things can be and maybe should be expressed in machine code, since that is pure computation. obviously this will change from machine to machine, so we may want to keep that in mind (could think of this as separate "languages")

we also think many things can be thought of as machines, with perhaps inputs and perhaps outputs and perhaps some processing.

we have in the past thought there to be two "categories" of machine: symbolic and neuro, although we recently think this may not be worth separating into two categories.
(here, symbolic refers to classical programs while neuro refers to things like AI and LLMs)

we initially thought of a system that could derive HoTT, which can in turn derive a great many other systems:
instead of the specific mathematical structures and rules that make up HoTT, our system is simply that:
mathematical structures and rules.
we then thought that mathematical structures are just rules.
we then thought that rules are sort of just if-then statements, or generally conditional branching in computation.
we then realize that every single computational instruction is practically conditional, since at least in the AMD64 programmers manual, most or all instructions can produce errors and alter various parts of the state in various ways (and SYSCALL makes things even weirder with calls to the kernel/OS that can do various things/fail/etc.).
thus, a system that can derive probably everything might well just be a common machine (processor + GPU, even FPGAs, RAM, storage (SSD), IO, etc.)
mathematics may then just be describable as derivations of computation, but fundamentally computation is the most base language and system of understanding
