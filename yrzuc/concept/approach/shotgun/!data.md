if we can't decide what to do, try doing all of the things (although really just pick one at random with the plan to pick other things).

the idea is that if we try all of the things for a bit, we may find ourselves enjoying one thing particularly or not enjoying one thing particularly.

for those things we enjoy, we can raise focus on them.
for those that do not spark joy, we can lower focus on them.
