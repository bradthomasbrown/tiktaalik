in the distance, on the horizon, you see something and you want to go there.
in front of you, there is a pit of snakes.
to the right of the pit of snakes, either nothing, a cliff, or a wall, or otherwise impassible terrain
to the left of the pit of snakes, a dozen doors that you cannot see through. things aren't quite euclidian, so it's reasonable that the dozen doors are all the same distance from you but none of them seem particularly like a shorter path to the goal on the horizon.
you don't want to go into the pit of snakes, reasonably.
so you go to one door, you open it, and you step through.
on the other side, you find that the horizon and the thing on the horizon is different, let's say before the thing was blue, now it's green.
in front of you now, the exact same thing from before. another pit of snakes, and a dozen more doors.
you have no idea now if your horizon from before even exists here. you think that going through one of these doors should bring you closer, but you also consider the possibility that your horizon could be somewhere else or not here at all. perhaps going through another door will "bring your horizon back", but closer, or maybe further, or maybe at the same distance.

do you keep going through doors, hoping it all works out?
do you chase new horizons?
do you go back and go through the pit of snakes?
are you making any progress whatsoever?

now imagine that looking past the pit of snakes, you can see the scenario repeats, over and over, extending to the horizon.
to get to your goal in the most intuitively efficient way would mean traversing through endless pits of snakes. you're not sure if you'd even make it if you did that, but at least you'd know your going the right direction.
on the other hand, *perhaps* some door or combination of doors could be more efficient, a shortcut. this would be great, but we cannot know this exists. perhaps some door or combination of doors are as efficient. at least we won't get eaten by snakes. perhaps some door or combination of doors are less efficient. now we must weight being attacked by snakes against the loss in efficiency.

perhaps going through any door guarantees we won't reach our goal on the horizon, since they change which direction we're going.
if we knew that was true, we'd *have* to go through the snakes.
