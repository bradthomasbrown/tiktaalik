bending notes is more interesting than we think might be commonly known or even known at all.

if we take a string and bend it, then play another string, such that the played notes are a unison, then unbending the string will give us a "continual movement" from a unison to some other interval, where every single moment in between can be thought of as as some other, strange, "not common" interval. (microtone intervals?)

if we play 3 notes and bend one, we can achieve very complex sounds and feelings, and in general if we play 2 notes and bend one, where the target interval isn't a unison but other intervals, we may achieve very complex sounds and feelings.
