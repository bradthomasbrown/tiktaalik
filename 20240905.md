I have an interesting predicament: If someone were to ask me "what do you do for a living?", I genuinely would not know how to answer that question.

Can you help me decipher what it is I do so that I can answer that question in a concise way? Ask me anything you may want clarified.



I'd be happy to help you figure out how to concisely describe what you do for a living. To get started, I'll need some more information about your work situation. Here are a few questions that could help clarify things:

1. Do you have a job or multiple jobs? If so, what are your main responsibilities?
2. Are you self-employed or do you run your own business?
3. Do you have any regular income-generating activities, even if they're not traditional jobs?
4. Are you currently in school or training for a particular field?
5. Do you engage in any volunteer work or unpaid activities that take up a significant amount of your time?
6. Are there any skills or areas of expertise that you frequently use, even if not in a formal job setting?

Feel free to answer any or all of these questions, or provide any other information you think might be relevant. The more details you can share, the better I can help you craft a concise answer to the "what do you do for a living?" question.



1. I think I might have a job, but my current situation is very strange. I have a hobby that has generated "bursts" of value about once every one to two years. The last "burst" generated so much value that I made the decision to quit my full-time "real" job so I can focus on the hobby. The hope or ideal is that either I can find a way to make a more stable income stream in place of the "bursts" or that future "bursts" will sustain my current living situation and expenditures.
2. I am technically am the sole member of an LLC, but none of the value generated from the hobby nor any of the things I've produced via the hobby have passed through, are owned, or have otherwise interacted with the LLC.
3. I do not have regular income-generating activities apart from the aforementioned previous "bursts" of value. So far there have been 3 or 4 of these burst events over about 4 years.
4. I am not in school or training. In fact, I have never really been in school or training, and most of everything I've learned is self-taught.
5. I would not say I do volunteer work, and I'm not sure if what I do in between "bursts" can be described as "unpaid activities" now that I am using the value generated to fund my lifestyle.
6. Definitely a focus on cryptocurrency and computer programming. The hobby in question is that I've made smart contract tokens on Ethereum, initially to test some hypotheses I had about other smart contract tokens but other people occasionally "discover" what it is I'm doing and exchange large quantities of the native coin Ethereum for my tokens, thus giving me access to "value" in some way. I've since expanded to more EVM chains than just Ethereum. I manage (not very well) a community for my token with a Telegram channel (mostly I am active there, I use it to share what I'm doing but most, if not all, people in there don't understand what I say or do). I also have an X profile representing the token and the LLC that's very inactive and a Discord that I don't really check, since I'm just not a fan of Discord. The token has a website with some explanations of what it is and what it does, and I made, run, and maintain that site. Everything is open source, and so far only one person has made some minor contributions to the front end of the website.



Thank you for providing such a detailed explanation of your situation. It's certainly unique and interesting. Based on the information you've shared, I can help you craft a concise answer to the question "What do you do for a living?" Here are a few options, starting from the most concise and expanding to provide more detail:

1. Most concise: "I'm a blockchain developer and entrepreneur."
2. Slightly more detailed: "I create and manage innovative cryptocurrency tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks."
3. With more context: "I'm an independent blockchain developer. I create experimental smart contract tokens that occasionally generate significant value, allowing me to focus on this work full-time."
4. If you want to emphasize the experimental nature: "I run a blockchain research and development project, creating experimental cryptocurrency tokens that explore new concepts in decentralized finance."

These descriptions capture the essence of what you do without delving into the complexities of your income structure or the specifics of your project. They also position your work as a legitimate profession, which it is, given that it sustains your lifestyle.

If you want to add more detail or feel that these don't quite capture what you do, we can refine them further. Would you like to adjust any of these options, or do you have a preference among them?





# Core Concepts and Techniques Analysis

## 1. Type-Safe Integer Handling

The primary goal appears to be creating a system for handling integer types with specific ranges (e.g., uint8, uint16, uint256) in a type-safe manner. This is particularly important in contexts where precision is crucial, such as cryptography or low-level systems programming.

## 2. Functional Decomposition

You're using a technique of functional decomposition to break down complex operations into simpler, composable functions. This is evident in your use of type aliases and function compositions like:

typescript

Copy

`type M__N_B = (m: M) => N_B type N_B = (n: N) => B`

This approach allows for greater flexibility and composability of your code.

## 3. Lazy Evaluation and Memoization

The use of a proxy object with a trap suggests an implementation of lazy evaluation. This allows for efficient creation of multiple similar functions (uint8, uint16, etc.) without the overhead of creating them all upfront. The use of a Map for caching (memoization) further optimizes this approach.

## 4. Algebraic Thinking

Your approach to breaking down problems into smaller, composable parts shows influences from algebraic thinking in functional programming. This is particularly evident in your decomposition technique and the way you're thinking about function compositions.

## 5. Hybrid Approach

You're consciously combining functional and imperative paradigms. While you're leveraging functional concepts for decomposition and composition, you're also pragmatically using imperative constructs where they make sense (e.g., for error handling and state management).

## 6. Type-Driven Development

There's a strong focus on types throughout your notes. You're using TypeScript's type system to enforce constraints and guide the design of your functions and data structures.

## 7. Abstraction and Generalization

You're working towards creating general-purpose, reusable components. For example, the `M__N_B` function is a generalized way to create range-checking functions for different integer types.

## Comparison to Existing Concepts

1. **Functional Programming in TypeScript**: Your approach aligns with techniques used in functional programming libraries for TypeScript, such as fp-ts or purify-ts.
2. **Smart Constructors**: Your integer creation functions are similar to the concept of "smart constructors" in functional programming, which ensure that only valid values can be constructed.
3. **Refinement Types**: The concept of having more specific number types (uint8, uint16, etc.) is similar to refinement types, which are types with additional constraints.
4. **Proxy-based API Design**: Your use of Proxy objects for lazy evaluation is reminiscent of techniques used in JavaScript libraries for creating flexible APIs.

## Potential Formalizations and Generalizations

1. **Category Theory**: Some of your functional compositions could potentially be formalized using concepts from category theory, which provides a mathematical foundation for many functional programming concepts.
2. **Effect Systems**: For handling errors and other side effects in a more functional way, you might explore effect systems or monadic error handling.
3. **Type-Level Programming**: TypeScript's type system could be leveraged even further to encode more constraints at the type level, potentially using conditional types and mapped types.
4. **Property-Based Testing**: Given the focus on well-defined ranges and behaviors, property-based testing could be a valuable addition to ensure correctness.

## Conclusion

Your approach demonstrates a thoughtful blend of functional and imperative programming paradigms, leveraging the strengths of both. By decomposing complex operations into simpler, composable functions and using lazy evaluation techniques, you're creating a flexible and efficient system for handling typed integers. This hybrid approach, combining functional concepts with pragmatic imperatives, can lead to code that is both robust and practical.

**Claude**
```ts
const createLazyM = (min: bigint, max: bigint) => {
  let m: M | undefined;
  return () => {
    if (m === undefined) {
      m = { min, max };
    } return m;
  };
};

const n_b: F<() => M, B> = function(this: () => M, n: N): B {
  const m = this();
  return n < m.min || n > m.max;
};

const m__n_b: F<M, typeof n_b> = function(min: bigint, max: bigint): F<N, B> {
  const lazyM = createLazyM(min, max);
  return n_b.bind(lazyM);
};
```

we're fascinated by claude's approach here
the effect should be that for some bound `n_b`, the `m` object is only created when `n_b` is called for the first time
