if you have an expression like `* -> * -> *`, what's a way to describe that and how it's different from an expression like `* -> *`​, preferably where the difference can be described as a numeric difference in some metric?

Edit

To describe and differentiate these expressions, we can use the concept of "arity" or "rank" in type theory and functional programming. Here's how we can break it down:

1. `* -> *`: This represents a unary type constructor or a function that takes one type and returns another type. Arity: 1
2. `* -> * -> *`: This represents a binary type constructor or a function that takes two types and returns a type. Arity: 2

The key difference between these expressions can be described numerically as the arity or rank of the type constructor:

- `* -> *` has an arity of 1
- `* -> * -> *` has an arity of 2

The numeric difference in arity between these two expressions is 1.

Another way to think about this is in terms of "currying" in functional programming:

- `* -> *` is a function that takes one argument and returns a result.
- `* -> * -> *` can be seen as a function that takes one argument and returns another function of type `* -> *`.

In this view, we could describe the difference as the "depth" or "level of currying":

- `* -> *` has a currying depth of 1
- `* -> * -> *` has a currying depth of 2

Again, the numeric difference in currying depth between these expressions is 1.

These metrics (arity or currying depth) provide a clear, numeric way to distinguish between type expressions with different numbers of arrows.

My current issue with using arity is that I'm operating in a space that isn't purely functional, so we may have functions with arities and the above difference is a difference in some other metric:

for example, we could have some function like `* * -> *` which could sometimes be "broken apart" into `* -> * -> *`​ but sometimes perhaps not.

In the first case, I'd describe `* * -> *`​ as an arity 2 function, and I would then no longer know how to describe `* -> * -> *`​ in a way that clearly discerns it from what I would otherwise call "an arity 2 function"

Is this a space that has been explored, such that there are existing, known, perhaps not formal or universal names and notation for this? Or will we need to produce our own names and notation?

Edit

Your observation is astute and touches on an important distinction in type theory and programming language design. This space has indeed been explored, particularly in the context of currying, uncurrying, and partial application. Let me break down the concepts and introduce some terminology that might help:

1. Uncurried form: `* * -> *` This is often called an "uncurried" or "tupled" function. It takes multiple arguments at once.
2. Curried form: `* -> * -> *` This is the "curried" version, where the function takes one argument and returns a function that takes the next argument.

The distinction you're making is important and has been studied in various contexts. Here are some terms and concepts that might be helpful:

1. Arity vs. Currying Depth:
    
    - Arity: The number of arguments a function takes in its uncurried form.
    - Currying Depth: The number of arrows in the curried form.
    
    In your example, `* * -> *` and `* -> * -> *` both have an arity of 2, but the latter has a currying depth of 2.
2. Argument Structure: Some languages and type systems make a distinction between:
    - Multiple-argument functions: `* * -> *`
    - Higher-order functions: `* -> (* -> *)`
3. Partial Application Potential: The curried form `* -> * -> *` allows for easy partial application, while `* * -> *` typically doesn't without additional language support.
4. Parameter Clustering: In some systems, `* * -> *` might indicate that the two parameters are more tightly coupled or should be considered as a pair, while `* -> * -> *` treats them more independently.

While there isn't a universally accepted single metric to distinguish these cases, here are some suggestions for describing or notating this difference:

1. Currying Notation:
    - Uncurried: `* * -> *`
    - Curried: `* -> * -> *`
2. Argument Structure Notation:
    - Tupled: `(*, *) -> *`
    - Curried: `* -> (* -> *)`
3. Arity and Depth Notation:
    - Arity/Depth: (2,1) for `* * -> *`
    - Arity/Depth: (2,2) for `* -> * -> *`
4. Application Style:
    - Eager: `* * -> *` (both arguments must be provided at once)
    - Lazy: `* -> * -> *` (arguments can be provided one at a time)

If you need to create your own notation, you might consider something like:

- `*,* -> *` for the uncurried form
- `*→*→*` (using a different arrow) for the curried form

Or perhaps:

- `*2 -> *` for the uncurried form (superscript indicating arity)
- `*¹→*¹→*` for the curried form (superscripts indicating currying depth)

These suggestions aim to capture the distinction you're making while building on existing concepts in type theory and functional programming. Depending on your specific use case and audience, you might need to define your own terminology or notation, but these ideas should provide a solid starting point.

I like the idea of "depth" used to describe the metric I'm attempting to pin down, and I wish to retain "arity" used to be a metric separate from depth.

A problem I'm trying to solve is in trying to compose two functions in a specific way that I haven't even been able to describe before. We have some `f` that is we can maybe describe as "depth 1, input arities 3, output arities 1". `* * * -> *` Although there is an interesting sort of "problem" with `f`, because it is really a JavaScript function where the last argument is a rest parameter. Technically then, it's an input arity of "at least 2". If we want to borrow from regex notation, we'll need to change up our notation so that we can use regex stars to express that: `x x * -> x`​ We may then want to differentiate the symbols so they can be identified, since we will be transforming it to match some desired target expression: `a b * -> d`​ The first transformation we'll do is one such that we want to increase the depth in a certain way, which we could perhaps describe as "splitting input 1 at index 2": `a b -> * -> d`​ But now we're going to want to do something which I have found extremely hard to even conceptually grasp. `f` is actually a function application method, where `a` is a function, `b` is the `this` value assigned to that function, and `*` are the parameters that the function will be applied to. This is a built-in function application method, and we've been obscuring an unfortunate fact that means we must make a new notation for discernment. `c`​ is actually not "zero or more" as a rest parameter, but rather an with zero or more elements representing what we would get with a rest parameter. So `f` is more like `a b -> [*] -> d`​. The "hard to grasp transformation" we want to then, is one such that we can take the above and get: `a b -> * -> d`​ ideally, I'd want some function that can make this transformation, and its form may be like this: `(a b -> [*] -> d) -> (a b -> * -> d)`​ or perhaps we can make a transforming function that's even more specific to our scenario: `(a b [*]) -> d) -> (a b -> * -> d)`​

and my original issue then would be "how on earth can i coerce such expressions into valid TypeScript identifiers that I can use to name equivalent functions?" and also "how can i do that while maintaining that the function names intuitively describe what they do?"

i'm considering that perhaps i don't try to coerce the expression into a valid typescript identifier at all, but maybe use objects with string properties where the string is my expression exactly

i also realize that the last signature can be generalized into something like 
`((a b c -> d) g) -> (a b -> g(c) -> d)`​ 
which itself could have its depth increased like 
`(a b c -> d) -> g -> (a b -> g(c) -> d)` 
or 
`g -> (a b c -> d) -> (a b -> g(c) -> d)` 
where our g would be some 
`* -> [*]`​

i wonder if there's some guideline that can be used to determine which (or at least the pros/cons) of the different orderings of those last 2 large signatures

Your exploration touches on several advanced concepts in type theory, functional programming, and language design. Let's break this down and try to formalize some notation and concepts to address your needs.

Function Composition and Transformation Notation

Click to open document

This notation and conceptual framework address the complex transformations you're working with. Here are some additional thoughts and suggestions:

1. Notation Flexibility: The notation you've developed is quite expressive. It allows for clear representation of currying, variadic functions, and complex transformations.
2. TypeScript Integration: For TypeScript, you might consider using a combination of type aliases and generics to represent these complex types. For example:
    
    typescript
    
    Copy
    
    `type VarArgsFunc<A, B, C, D> = (a: A, b: B, ...args: C[]) => D; type CurriedVarArgsFunc<A, B, C, D> = (a: A, b: B) => (...args: C[]) => D; type Transform<A, B, C, D> = (f: VarArgsFunc<A, B, C, D>) => CurriedVarArgsFunc<A, B, C, D>;`
    
3. Naming Conventions: As you suggested, using objects with string properties for the full expressions is a valid approach. It maintains clarity and allows for dynamic access. For more direct use in TypeScript, you could create a naming scheme based on the operation, like `curryVarArgsTransform` or `applyAndCurryTransform`.
4. Generalized Transformations: Your generalized transformation `((a b c -> d) g) -> (a b -> g(c) -> d)` is particularly interesting. It represents a higher-order function that not only transforms the structure of the function but also applies an additional transformation `g` to the variadic part.
5. Ordering Considerations: For the ordering of `g` and `(a b c -> d)` in your generalized transformation, both approaches have merits:
    - `g -> (a b c -> d) -> (a b -> g(c) -> d)` follows the "data last" principle common in functional programming, allowing for easier partial application.
    - `(a b c -> d) -> g -> (a b -> g(c) -> d)` might be more intuitive to read as "transform this function using this transformer".The choice largely depends on your use case and coding style preferences.
6. Documentation: Given the complexity of these transformations, thorough documentation will be crucial. Consider creating a small DSL (Domain Specific Language) or at least a well-defined set of terms to describe these operations consistently.
7. Testing: Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure that each transformation behaves as expected, especially for edge cases involving different arities and types.

This framework provides a solid foundation for working with and describing these complex function transformations. As you continue to develop this system, you might find it evolving into a more formal type manipulation library, which could be valuable for advanced functional programming in TypeScript.
