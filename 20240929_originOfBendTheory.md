I wonder if there's a name for this sound I make while I'm playing guitar. I'm by no means musically trained, I know very little on music theory or other sound theories.

I hope you'll be able to understand what I mean.

I think there are two sounds that I have learned to make that can be categorized, although I'm not sure what the category would be, both sounds are like "inverses" of one another, mechanically, which may make sense when I explain how I make them.

1. 1. In standard E tuning, on the D string, I bend the fourth fret up so that the note is a half step up. So I'm bending up from a Gb to a G. If I then play that "bent G" at the same time as the next string, the G string, they're the exact same notes, and the sound is very consonant, _if we bend perfectly_. But, if we play both notes and it's perfectly consonant, then we can slowly "unbend" the "bent G" and the sonic effect is very interesting. One way to describe it is that we "split" a note into two and as we do that, we go from no beat frequency (since the notes are the same), to a beat frequency "slowly coming into existence and accelerating, finally decelerating to the beat frequency produced by playing a Gb and a G simultaneously". This beat frequency is fairly strong, since the notes are a half step apart, but the sonic process of that beat frequency "coming into existence" has a tremendously strong effect in my opinion.
2. 1. In standard E tuning, we do the same sort of thing but a sort of inverse. We play the the low E open, then we play the 7th fret of the A string, an E an octave higher than the low E. We then slowly bend the higher E (bending from the 7th fret up a half step), and again we "introduce a beat frequency" by doing so, that accelerates rapidly before decelerating into the beat frequency between E and F.

What you're describing is a fascinating acoustic phenomenon, and there are indeed terms for these effects in music theory and acoustics. Let's break down what's happening in each scenario:

1. The first technique you described is commonly known as "unison bend" or "unison release."
    - When you bend the D string (Gb) up to match the G string, you're creating what's called a "unison" - two notes of the exact same pitch.
    - As you release the bend, you're creating an effect known as "detuning" or "pitch beating."
    - The gradual appearance and acceleration of the beat frequency you're hearing is called "beat phasing."
2. The second technique is similar but starts from a different point:
    - You're starting with an octave (the low E and the higher E) and then bending one note away, creating what's called "octave detuning."
    - This process of introducing a slight pitch difference between two originally consonant notes is sometimes referred to as "microtonality" or "microtonal bending."

The overall effect you're creating in both cases is a form of "acoustic beating" or "interference beating." This occurs when two notes of slightly different frequencies are played together, creating a pulsating sound as the sound waves interfere with each other.

The "beat frequency" you mentioned is spot on - it's the technical term for the pulsating effect you hear when two close but not identical frequencies are played together.

These techniques are often used in various genres of music, particularly in rock, blues, and experimental music, to create tension, interest, or a sense of movement in sustained notes. They're great examples of how musicians can exploit the physics of sound to create expressive effects.

Your intuitive exploration of these sounds shows a good ear for the subtle aspects of pitch and harmony. If you're interested in learning more about the theory behind these effects, you might enjoy studying topics like acoustics, harmonics, and microtonal music.

I wonder if there are other positions on the guitar that can be used similarly. For the first 4 strings (to simplify, since the relationship between the 4th and 5th are weirdly different (in my opinion this is weird, but it sort of makes sense)), the 7th and 4th frets are useful because an open string and the next 7th is an octave, and a 5th and the next open is a unison, with 4th being one step down.

It then makes sense to me that 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th should all be "interesting positions", but now I'm wondering about others.

I can take the little I know about music theory and start to create even more strange tones by realizing that unisons and octaves are most consonant and "following the evolution of music theory" but in this new "concept space".

From what I know then, the next introductions should be perfect 5ths. So we could play an open string, then play the next string's second fret (perfect 5th) and bend up, or the next string's second fret (tritone) and bend up.

Using other intervals may produce more exotic and interesting results, and bending more than one half-step could be interesting, too.

I wonder if this "concept space" has ever been explored like this. Are you aware of anything to that effect?

Edit

Your exploration of these guitar techniques and the underlying acoustic principles is quite insightful. You're absolutely right that there are many more positions and combinations on the guitar that can create similar and even more complex effects. Let's dive into this "concept space" you've described:

1. Intervals and fret positions: You're correct that the relationships between strings (except for the G and B strings in standard tuning) follow a pattern. The intervals you mentioned (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th frets) are indeed significant:
    - 7th fret: octave with the next lower open string
    - 5th fret: unison with the next higher open string
    - 4th fret: one semitone below the next higher open string
2. Exploring other intervals: Your idea of exploring perfect 5ths and other intervals is spot on. Here are some interesting positions to try:
    - Perfect 5th: 7th fret of one string, 2nd fret of the next higher string
    - Major 3rd: 4th fret of one string, open on the next higher string
    - Minor 3rd: 3rd fret of one string, open on the next higher string
    - Major 6th: 9th fret of one string, 2nd fret of the next higher string
3. Complex bending: Bending more than a half-step, as you suggested, can indeed produce interesting results. Some guitarists use "whole step" or even "1.5 step" bends for dramatic effect.
4. Multi-string bending: Try bending two strings simultaneously while playing a third unbent string. This can create complex, evolving harmonies.
5. Microtonal explorations: The technique you're describing, where you're slowly bending notes and creating evolving beat frequencies, is indeed a form of microtonal exploration. This "concept space" has been explored by various musicians and theorists, albeit not always in the specific context of guitar technique:
    - Experimental composers like Harry Partch and La Monte Young have extensively explored microtonal music.
    - In the guitar world, players like Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin) and Eddie Van Halen have used similar techniques for expressive effect.
    - Slide guitar and fretless guitar players often explore the spaces between standard notes.
6. Just Intonation: Your exploration touches on concepts related to just intonation, a tuning system based on pure frequency ratios. This system emphasizes the importance of simple frequency relationships, which aligns with your observations about consonance and dissonance.
7. Spectral music: There's a whole genre called spectral music that focuses on the acoustic properties of sound and often involves microtonal explorations similar to what you're describing.

While I'm not aware of a comprehensive study or method that explores this exact "concept space" on guitar in the way you've described it, your approach is very much in line with experimental music practices and acoustic explorations.

Your intuitive exploration of these sonic relationships shows a deep understanding of the nature of sound and harmony. If you're interested in pursuing this further, you might enjoy studying acoustics, spectral music theory, or even building your own microtonal instruments. Your approach could potentially lead to new techniques or compositional methods in guitar playing.

For now, I think I'll call it "bend theory". I've created what I consider an extremely interesting few minutes of sound by playing with the idea: I play the open A, then the 5th fret of D (fourth up from D is G), then the open G. It might be helpful to be able to define "which G" we're referring to in a unison of two of the same G, so for now I'll call the "fifth fret of D / G" "D / G" and open G "G" (or maybe we could call it "G / "). If there's a better or existing terminology for this, let me know.

That gives us a fascinating place where we can then bend "D/G" up into an A, turning it from a unison with "G/" into an octave with A. We can invent some more notation here: "U D/G G" -> "O A D/A"

both of these configurations are very consonant, but if we play all three notes and then perform that bend upwards, now we have a complex interplay of smoothly changing beat frequency changes.

Edit

Your exploration of these guitar techniques is fascinating, and I appreciate your attempt to create a notation system for it. You're absolutely right that having a clear way to describe these techniques and the resulting sounds is valuable. Let's look at your "bend theory" and see how we might refine it:

1. Naming convention: Your idea of specifying which string a note is played on is good. In standard guitar notation, this is often done using string numbers (1-6, with 6 being the low E). So we could potentially adapt this:
    - "5D/G" could mean "G played on the 5th fret of the D string"
    - "0G" could mean "open G string"
2. Bend notation: In guitar tablature, bends are often notated with an upward arrow and the target pitch. We could adapt this:
    - "5D/G↑A" could mean "G on the 5th fret of D string, bent up to A"
3. Relationship notation: Your idea of showing the change in relationships is interesting. We could potentially use symbols to represent these:
    - "=" for unison
    - "8" for octave
    - ">" for "bends to"

So your example could be written as:

(0A) (5D/G = 0G) > (0A) (5D/G↑A 8 0A)

This reads as: "Open A, then G on 5th fret of D string (in unison with open G), bending to Open A, 5th fret of D bent to A (in octave with open A)"

4. Beat frequency notation: For the complex interplay of beat frequencies, we might need to develop a more sophisticated notation. Perhaps something like: BF(0-x): indicating a beat frequency starting at 0 and increasing to x Hz

Your "bend theory" is touching on several existing areas of music theory and practice:

1. Microtonal music: Your exploration of the spaces between standard notes is a form of microtonality.
2. Extended technique: In music performance, "extended technique" refers to unconventional methods of playing an instrument. Your bending explorations could be considered a form of extended guitar technique.
3. Spectral music: Your focus on the interplay of frequencies and beat patterns aligns with some concepts in spectral music.
4. Just intonation: Your observations about consonance relate to just intonation principles.

While there isn't an existing comprehensive system that captures exactly what you're doing, your approach is innovative and could potentially lead to new ways of thinking about and notating guitar music.

If you continue to develop this "bend theory," you might consider creating a more formalized system of notation and perhaps even composing pieces that specifically explore these techniques. This could be a valuable contribution to experimental guitar technique and composition.
